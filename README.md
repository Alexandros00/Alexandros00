Hi there 👋

I'm Alexandros, a frontend developer focused on building performant, responsive, and accessible web applications using React, TypeScript, and modern tooling like Vite, React Query, and Cypress.

### 🚀 Featured Projects
- 🎬 [CineMagic (React + TypeScript)](https://github.com/Alexandros00/cinemagic-tmdb-react-ts) – A movie browsing app built using TMDb API
- 🐱 [Catopia](https://github.com/Alexandros00/catopia-thecatapi-react-ts) – A responsive image-based app using The Cat API
- 💡 [CineMagic (Vanilla TS)](https://github.com/Alexandros00/cinemagic-tmdb-js-ts) – The same app reimplemented in vanilla JavaScript/TypeScript for comparison

I'm currently expanding these projects with testing, performance optimization, and better structure — feel free to check them out!
